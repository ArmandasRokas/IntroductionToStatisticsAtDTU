How to formally answer this question is presented in Chapter 3, but consider now which summary statistics and/or plots would you look at to have some idea of what the answer will be? I would answer something like this: the most patients decreased cholesterol level between 1.1 and 1.6, which is Inner Quartile Range (IQR). However the worst result recorded is -0.2 and the best is 2.1. Lastly the mean is 1.21 and the median is 1.3.","title":"1 Descriptive Statistics"},{"location":"chapter_1/#1-descriptive-statistics","text":"","title":"1 Descriptive Statistics"},{"location":"chapter_1/#11-infant-birth-weight","text":"In a study of different occupational groups the infant birth weight was recorded for randomly selected babies born by hairdressers, who had their first child.

What is the probability that the 10 purchased bales of hay are error-free, if 1% of the bales from a supplier are infected ( p_{1} p_{1} ) and the probability that the 10 purchased bales of hay are error-free, if 10% of the bales from a supplier are infected ( p_{10} p_{10} ) ?

The expected error rate is the probability of manufacturing an item shorter than 2993 and longer than 3007, so: L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 > pnorm ( 3007 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.9901847 > pnorm ( 2993 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.009815329 b) The concrete items are supported by beams, where the distance between the beams is called Lbeam and can be assumed normal distributed. The concrete items length is still called L. For the items to be supported correctly, the following requirements for these lengths must be fulfilled: 90mm < L - Lbeam < 110 mm. It is assumed that the mean of the distance between the beams is mbeam = 2900 mm. How large may the standard deviation sigmabeam of the distance between the beams be if you want the requirement fulfilled in 99% of the cases? Find: \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} Needs be fulfilled: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 We know: L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ We can draw a graph like this, because 99% of all distances should between 90 and 110. So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 2.13 Online statistic video views In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online.

So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107","title":"b)"},{"location":"chapter_2/#213-online-statistic-video-views","text":"In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online.

Calculate the following probabilities: P(X\\leqslant20) = 0.1586553 P(X\\leqslant20) = 0.1586553 > pnorm ( 20 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 ) ) [ 1 ] 0.1586553 P(X>29.5) = 1 - P(X\\leqslant29.5) = 0.08456572 P(X>29.5) = 1 - P(X\\leqslant29.5) = 0.08456572 > 1 - pnorm ( 29.5 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 ) ) [ 1 ] 0.08456572 P(X=23.8) = 0.09961098 P(X=23.8) = 0.09961098 > dnorm ( 23.8 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 )) [ 1 ] 0.09961098 2.11 Computer chip control A machine for checking computer chips uses on average 65 milliseconds per check with a standard deviation of 4 milliseconds. A newer machine, potentially to be bought, uses on average 54 milliseconds per check with a standard deviation of 3 milliseconds. It can be used that check times can be assumed normally distributed and independent. a) What is the probability that the time savings per check using the new machine is less than 10 milliseconds is? By theorem 2.40 and example 2.41: X \\sim N(65,16) \\\\ Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ Z = X - Y \\\\ \\mu_{Z} =\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y} = 65-54=11 \\\\ \\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{X}+\\sigma^2_{Y}= 16+9=25\\\\ Z\\sim N(11,25)\\\\ P(Z\\leqslant10)=0.4207403 X \\sim N(65,16) \\\\ Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ Z = X - Y \\\\ \\mu_{Z} =\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y} = 65-54=11 \\\\ \\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{X}+\\sigma^2_{Y}= 16+9=25\\\\ Z\\sim N(11,25)\\\\ P(Z\\leqslant10)=0.4207403 > pnorm ( 10 , 11 , sqrt ( 25 )) [ 1 ] 0.4207403 Note that it does not matter in continuous distributions if we use < < or \\leqslant \\leqslant in order to define the probability. b) What is the mean and standard deviation for the total time use for checking 100 chips on the new machine is? By theorem 2.56: Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ \\mu_{Z}= 100*E(X)= 100*54= 5400 \\\\ \\sigma_{Z} = \\sqrt{V(100X)} = \\sqrt{100*9} = 30 Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ \\mu_{Z}= 100*E(X)= 100*54= 5400 \\\\ \\sigma_{Z} = \\sqrt{V(100X)} = \\sqrt{100*9} = 30 2.12 Concrete items A manufacturer of concrete items knows that the length (L) of his items are reasonably normally distributed with \\mu_{L} \\mu_{L} = 3000 mm and \\sigma_{L} \\sigma_{L} = 3 mm. The requirement for these elements is that the length should be not more than 3007 mm and the length must be at least 2993 mm. a) The expected error rate in the manufacturing will be? The expected error rate is the probability of manufacturing an item shorter than 2993 and longer than 3007, so: L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 > pnorm ( 3007 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.9901847 > pnorm ( 2993 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.009815329 b) The concrete items are supported by beams, where the distance between the beams is called L_{beam} L_{beam} and can be assumed normal distributed. The concrete items length is still called L L . For the items to be supported correctly, the following requirements for these lengths must be fulfilled: 90mm < L - L_{beam} L - L_{beam} < 110 mm. It is assumed that the mean of the distance between the beams is \\mu_{beam} \\mu_{beam} = 2900 mm. How large may the standard deviation \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} of the distance between the beams be if you want the requirement fulfilled in 99% of the cases? Find: \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} Needs be fulfilled: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 We know: L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ We can draw a graph like this, because 99% of all distances should between 90 and 110. So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 2.13 Online statistic video views In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online. Assume first that the occurrence of views through 2014 follows a Poisson process with a 2013 average: \\lambda_{365days} = 110000 \\lambda_{365days} = 110000 . a) What is the probability that in a randomly chosen half an hour there is no occurrence of views?
