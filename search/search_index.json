How to formally answer this question is presented in Chapter 3, but consider now which summary statistics and/or plots would you look at to have some idea of what the answer will be? I would answer something like this: the most patients decreased cholesterol level between 1.1 and 1.6, which is Inner Quartile Range (IQR). However the worst result recorded is -0.2 and the best is 2.1. Lastly the mean is 1.21 and the median is 1.3.","title":"1 Descriptive Statistics"},{"location":"chapter_1/#1-descriptive-statistics","text":"","title":"1 Descriptive Statistics"},{"location":"chapter_1/#11-infant-birth-weight","text":"In a study of different occupational groups the infant birth weight was recorded for randomly selected babies born by hairdressers, who had their first child.

What is the probability that the 10 purchased bales of hay are error-free, if 1% of the bales from a supplier are infected ( p_{1} p_{1} ) and the probability that the 10 purchased bales of hay are error-free, if 10% of the bales from a supplier are infected ( p_{10} p_{10} ) ?

The expected error rate is the probability of manufacturing an item shorter than 2993 and longer than 3007, so: L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 > pnorm ( 3007 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.9901847 > pnorm ( 2993 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.009815329 b) The concrete items are supported by beams, where the distance between the beams is called Lbeam and can be assumed normal distributed. The concrete items length is still called L. For the items to be supported correctly, the following requirements for these lengths must be fulfilled: 90mm < L - Lbeam < 110 mm. It is assumed that the mean of the distance between the beams is mbeam = 2900 mm. How large may the standard deviation sigmabeam of the distance between the beams be if you want the requirement fulfilled in 99% of the cases? Find: \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} Needs be fulfilled: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 We know: L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ We can draw a graph like this, because 99% of all distances should between 90 and 110. So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 2.13 Online statistic video views In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online.

So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107","title":"b)"},{"location":"chapter_2/#213-online-statistic-video-views","text":"In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online.

Calculate the following probabilities: P(X\\leqslant20) = 0.1586553 P(X\\leqslant20) = 0.1586553 > pnorm ( 20 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 ) ) [ 1 ] 0.1586553 P(X>29.5) = 1 - P(X\\leqslant29.5) = 0.08456572 P(X>29.5) = 1 - P(X\\leqslant29.5) = 0.08456572 > 1 - pnorm ( 29.5 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 ) ) [ 1 ] 0.08456572 P(X=23.8) = 0.09961098 P(X=23.8) = 0.09961098 > dnorm ( 23.8 , mean = 24 , sd = sqrt ( 16 )) [ 1 ] 0.09961098 2.11 Computer chip control A machine for checking computer chips uses on average 65 milliseconds per check with a standard deviation of 4 milliseconds. A newer machine, potentially to be bought, uses on average 54 milliseconds per check with a standard deviation of 3 milliseconds. It can be used that check times can be assumed normally distributed and independent. a) What is the probability that the time savings per check using the new machine is less than 10 milliseconds is? By theorem 2.40 and example 2.41: X \\sim N(65,16) \\\\ Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ Z = X - Y \\\\ \\mu_{Z} =\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y} = 65-54=11 \\\\ \\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{X}+\\sigma^2_{Y}= 16+9=25\\\\ Z\\sim N(11,25)\\\\ P(Z\\leqslant10)=0.4207403 X \\sim N(65,16) \\\\ Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ Z = X - Y \\\\ \\mu_{Z} =\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y} = 65-54=11 \\\\ \\sigma^2_{Z} = \\sigma^2_{X}+\\sigma^2_{Y}= 16+9=25\\\\ Z\\sim N(11,25)\\\\ P(Z\\leqslant10)=0.4207403 > pnorm ( 10 , 11 , sqrt ( 25 )) [ 1 ] 0.4207403 Note that it does not matter in continuous distributions if we use < < or \\leqslant \\leqslant in order to define the probability. b) What is the mean and standard deviation for the total time use for checking 100 chips on the new machine is? By theorem 2.56: Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ \\mu_{Z}= 100*E(X)= 100*54= 5400 \\\\ \\sigma_{Z} = \\sqrt{V(100X)} = \\sqrt{100*9} = 30 Y \\sim N(54,9) \\\\ \\mu_{Z}= 100*E(X)= 100*54= 5400 \\\\ \\sigma_{Z} = \\sqrt{V(100X)} = \\sqrt{100*9} = 30 2.12 Concrete items A manufacturer of concrete items knows that the length (L) of his items are reasonably normally distributed with \\mu_{L} \\mu_{L} = 3000 mm and \\sigma_{L} \\sigma_{L} = 3 mm. The requirement for these elements is that the length should be not more than 3007 mm and the length must be at least 2993 mm. a) The expected error rate in the manufacturing will be? The expected error rate is the probability of manufacturing an item shorter than 2993 and longer than 3007, so: L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ L \\sim (3000, 9)\\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(L>3007) = 1 - P(L<3007) \\\\ P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 P(2993>L>3007) = P(L>3007) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1 - P(L<3007)) + P(L<2993) = \\\\ (1-0.9901847) + 0.009815329 = 0.01963066 > pnorm ( 3007 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.9901847 > pnorm ( 2993 , mean = 3000 , sd = sqrt ( 9 )) [ 1 ] 0.009815329 b) The concrete items are supported by beams, where the distance between the beams is called L_{beam} L_{beam} and can be assumed normal distributed. The concrete items length is still called L L . For the items to be supported correctly, the following requirements for these lengths must be fulfilled: 90mm < L - L_{beam} L - L_{beam} < 110 mm. It is assumed that the mean of the distance between the beams is \\mu_{beam} \\mu_{beam} = 2900 mm. How large may the standard deviation \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} of the distance between the beams be if you want the requirement fulfilled in 99% of the cases? Find: \\sigma_{beam} \\sigma_{beam} Needs be fulfilled: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.99 We know: L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ L\\sim(3000,9)\\\\ L_{beam} \\sim (2900, \\sigma^2_{beam}) \\\\ \\mu_{L-L_{beam}}=\\mu_{L}-\\mu_{beam}=3000-2900=100\\\\ \\sigma_{L-L_{beam}}=\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}\\\\ We can draw a graph like this, because 99% of all distances should between 90 and 110. So there is only 0.5% left in each side, that the 0.005 quantile is at 90 and the 0.995 quantile is at 110: We can also write this like following: P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ P(90<L-L_{beam}<110) = P(L-L_{beam}<110) - P(L-L_{beam}<90) \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<110) = 0.995 \\\\ P(L-L_{beam}<90) = 0.005 \\\\ We can use theorem 2.43 in order to find a standard deviation of the distance, because the value of the standardized normal random variable at 0.005 quantile should be equal to the transformed distance variable: z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.005} = \\frac{90-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} And the same at 0.995 quantile: z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995} = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} We choose the second equation: z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} z_{0.995}= 2.575829 \\\\ 2.575829 = \\frac{110-100}{\\sqrt{9+\\sigma^2_{beam}}} > qnorm ( 0.995 ) [ 1 ] 2.575829 So the result is: \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 \\sigma_{beam} = 2.464107 2.13 Online statistic video views In 2013, there were 110,000 views of the DTU statistics videos that are available online. Assume first that the occurrence of views through 2014 follows a Poisson process with a 2013 average: \\lambda_{365days} = 110000 \\lambda_{365days} = 110000 . a) What is the probability that in a randomly chosen half an hour there is no occurrence of views?

For obtaining, if possible, a model for the influence of temperature on the folding thickness, n = 12 related set of values of temperature and the fold thickness were measured that is illustrated in the following figure: a) Determine by looking at the figure, which of the following sets of estimates for the parameters in the usual regression model is correct: \\hat{\\beta_0}=0 \\hat{\\beta_0}=0 , \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 , \\hat{\\sigma}=36 \\hat{\\sigma}=36 \\hat{\\beta_0}=0 \\hat{\\beta_0}=0 , \\hat{\\beta_1}=0.9 \\hat{\\beta_1}=0.9 , \\hat{\\sigma}=3.6 \\hat{\\sigma}=3.6 \\hat{\\beta_0}=252 \\hat{\\beta_0}=252 , \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 , \\hat{\\sigma}=3.6 \\hat{\\sigma}=3.6 \\hat{\\beta_0}=-252 \\hat{\\beta_0}=-252 , \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 , \\hat{\\sigma}=36 \\hat{\\sigma}=36 \\hat{\\beta_0}=252 \\hat{\\beta_0}=252 , \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 \\hat{\\beta_1}=-0.9 , \\hat{\\sigma}=36 \\hat{\\sigma}=36 The only possible intercept \\beta_0 \\beta_0 among the ones given in the answers is 252, because the line continues to ascend to the left, and it must cross y-axis somewhere above 130. The slope estimate of -0.9 in these two options looks reasonable, because the line goes downward. The estimated standard deviation of the error s_e =\\hat{\\sigma} s_e =\\hat{\\sigma} is 3.6, because from the figure it is clear that the points are NOT having an average vertical distance to the line in the size of 36. So the answer is 3. b) What is the only possible correct answer: The proportion of explained variation is 50% and the correlation is 0.98 The proportion of explained variation is 0% and the correlation is -0.98 The proportion of explained variation is 96% and the correlation is -1 The proportion of explained variation is 96% and the correlation is 0.98 The proportion of explained variation is 96% and the correlation is -0.98 The proportion of variation explained must be pretty high, because the observations are pretty close to the line. That means that 96% of total variation is explained by the line. Answer 1 and 4 are ruled out since the correlation clearly is negative. This also narrows the possibilities down to answer 3 and 5. And since the correlation is NOT exactly -1 (in which case the observations would be exactly on the line), the correct answer is: 5 5.2 Linear regression life time model A company manufactures an electronic device to be used in a very wide temperature range. The company knows that increased temperature shortens the life time of the device, and a study is therefore performed in which the life time is determined as a function of temperature. The following data is found: Temperature in Celsius (t) Life time in hours(y) 10 420 20 365 30 285 40 220 50 176 60 117 70 69 80 34 90 5 a) Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the slope in the usual linear regression model, which expresses the life time as a linear function of the temperature.

The following data of corresponding values of x and y is found: Temperature in \u00b0C (x) Yield in grams(y) 0 14 25 38 50 54 75 76 100 95 The average and standard deviation of temperature and yield are $$ \\bar{x} = 50 , s_x = 39.52847, \\bar{y}=55.4, s_y=31.66702 s_y=31.66702 $$ In the exercise the usual linear regression model is used Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i+ \\epsilon_i\\text{ , } \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\text{, } i = 1,...,5 Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i+ \\epsilon_i\\text{ , } \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\text{, } i = 1,...,5 a) Can a significant relationship between yield and temperature be documented on the usual significance level \\alpha = 0.05 \\alpha = 0.05 ? In R output P-value of the slope is only 6.27*10^{-5} 6.27*10^{-5} that is less than 0.05 0.05 . So we can conclude that there is a significant relationship between yield and temperature b) Give the 95% confidence interval of the expected yield at a temperature of x_{new}= 80 \u00b0C x_{new}= 80 \u00b0C .

Upper quantile = Q_3 Q_3 = q_{0.75} q_{0.75} $$ pn= 0.75*5 = 3.75 $$ pn pn is not an integer, so we take \"next one\" in the list, that is 4. > sort ( fit $ residuals )[ 4 ] 4 0.6 Thus the answer is: 0.6 5.4 Plastic material In the manufacturing of a plastic material, it is believed that the cooling time has an influence on the impact strength. Therefore a study is carried out in which plastic material impact strength is determined for 4 different cooling times. The results of this experiment are shown in the following table: Cooling times in seconds(x) Impact strength in kJ/m^2 kJ/m^2 (y) 15 42.1 25 36.0 35 31.8 40 28.7 The following statistics may by used: $$ \\bar{x} = 28.75, \\bar{y}=34.65, S_{xx}=368.75 $$ a) What is the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression model, expressing the impact strength as a linear function of the cooling time? x <- c ( 15 , 25 , 35 , 40 ) y <- c ( 42.1 , 36.0 , 31.8 , 28.7 ) xbar <- 28.75 ybar <- 34.65 Sxx <- 368.75 fit <- lm ( y ~ x ) out <- summary ( fit ) beta1hat <- coef ( fit )[ 2 ] sigmabeta1 <- out $ coefficients [ 2 , 2 ] c ( beta1hat - qt (( 1-0.05 / 2 ), df = length ( x ) -2 ) * sigmabeta1 , beta1hat + qt (( 1-0.05 / 2 ), df = length ( x ) -2 ) * sigmabeta1 ) -0.6460407 -0.3966711 So the answer is that we accept \\beta_1 \\in [-0.6460407, -0.3966711] \\beta_1 \\in [-0.6460407, -0.3966711] b) Can you conclude that there is a relation between the impact strength and the cooling time at significance level \\alpha \\alpha = 5%? pvalue1 <- out $ coefficients [ 2 , 4 ] 0.003075239 \\text{p-value}_1 \\text{p-value}_1 is less than \\alpha = 0.05 \\alpha = 0.05 , so we can conclude that there is a relation between the impact strength and the cooling time. In other words, the relation is statically significant. c) For a similar plastic material the tabulated value for the linear relation between temperature and impact strength (i.e the slope) is -0.30.
